              <td>Engagement: How engaging is the app? Is it visually appealing? Does it have sound and animation to capture the user’s attention? Does it have a good balance of challenge and reward? </td>
              <td style = "background-color:lightgreen;">I found Mimo to be very engaging overall. The lessons can be completed in short ~5 min bursts and I found this encouraged me to pick up the iPad.The lessons consist of 3 types of interaction, one where you read a short piece and pick the correct answer from a list, the second you must type a short piece of code from memory and the third where you examine a snippet of code and try to spot the error. If you get the correct answer there is a little satisfying beep and the answer turns green.Even the menu design is engaging as your learning path is laid out like a map and you must complete enough lessons on one area to unlock the next. 10/10</td>
              <td style = "background-color:rgb(238, 205, 144);">SoloLearn is also a very engaging app. It was released around a year after Mimo and you can tell Mimo's design was a big inspiration. It has the same mix of question types and uses a similar sytstem of pleasant chimes when you get an answer correct. The answers also turn green. The interface feels a little more sterile than Mimo's however. Lessons are arranged in a list of grey rectangles, it lacks polish and felt much less like a game than mimo. 5/10.</td>
              <td style = "background-color:rgb(206, 70, 70);">Tenuto is the least visually appealing of the three apps I audited. The main interface is just a list of topics and feels more akin to a book than a game. The lessons themselves though are mostly great. It has various games for teaching music theory ranging from trying to pick the correct notes on a staff to listening to notes played on a piano and trying to identify them by ear. Some of these lessons are very challenging however and there is no reward other than a personal high score. If learning music theory is your goal, this app is amazing however it isnt fun to use. There is very little motivatin from the app to continue using it. 4/10</td>

            <tr>
              <td>Progress tracking: How well does the app track the user’s progress? Does it provide feedback and recommendations to help users improve their performance? Does it use data to personalise the learning experience? </td>
              <td style = "background-color:lightgreen;">The app uses a few methods of tracking a users progress. Firstly there is a streak counter which tracks how many days in a row you have used the app. Then there are coins you earn for completing lessons which can be redeemed in the store for extra lives or rest days which pause the streak counter. There is also a points sytem where you earn points for each correct answer and bonus points for each completed lesson. These points are displayed on a global leaderboard where you can see your progress compared to users worldwide. The app on first lauch asks what your learning goals are and reccomends how much time you should spend each day. It also has an option to send a reminder at a specific time each day. 9/10</td>
              <td style = "background-color:rgb(238, 205, 144);">SoloLearn uses a points system to track your progress and uses a global leaderboard to compare to all users of the app. There is also a green progress bar along the top to show how close you are to completing a topic. These feel secondary within the app though, I far prefer Mimo's progress tracking. 4/10</td>
              <td style = "background-color:rgb(206, 70, 70);">Tenutos only progress tracking is in the form of a high score for each individual game. There is no tracker for how your overall progress is going or a way to see how you stack up against the rest of the world. There isnt even an option to set daily reminders to pratice. 0/10</td>

                <td>User experience: How user-friendly is the app? Is it easy to navigate and use? Does it have clear instructions and prompts? Does it have a well-designed interface? </td>
                <td style = "background-color:lightgreen;">For ease of use, Mimo is fantastic! The app is easy to navigate, everything is clearly labled and the icons are large. The map style lesson layout is especially user friendly as you can see how each new lesson learned ties into the overall picture of the topic. 10/10</td>
                <td style = "background-color:lightgreen;">While the app has a broad range of topics and lessons, the interface feels sterile. The gamification is minimal. The premium lessons are on the same list as the free ones and having greyed out modules all along my progress track kills motivation. It's not all bad though, the actual lessons themselves are well well-designed, there are only two interactions: answer the question or quit. While the rest of the app feels cluttered, the lessons are clean. 7/10</td>
                <td style = "background-color:lightgreen;">Tenuto is very user friendly. There are no distractions, no adds and no profiles. The lessons are all clearly labled. The learning games are simple to understand, the icons are large. Lessons are stacked from easiest to hardest even though the app doesnt make this clear. 8/10</td>
